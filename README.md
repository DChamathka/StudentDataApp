# StudentDataApp

## Java + MySQL
### Application for enter student data to the database
### Build by following a tutorial


#### Before run this go to the file DBConnect.java (path: src --> codes --> DBConnect.java )
#### Then go to the 16th line and provide database name, username and password (Before that you need to create MySQL database and table as follows)
 * Give any name for database
 * create new table name as 'student'
 * then create columns "id"- int(15), "sName"- Varchar(50), "sAge"- int(2) and "sGrade"- Varchar(2)


 * Rather than that you can import "student.sql" file to the database. (This file attached on repository)
